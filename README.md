# Inventory Management System

This is an advanced inventory management system developed in Python. It adeptly manages diverse product listings, quantities, and promotional strategies, thus enhancing sales and user satisfaction.

## Features
- **Product Management:** Handles diverse product listings and quantities. This includes support for non-stockable and limited-quantity items.
- **Promotional Strategies:** Dynamic promotional strategies are integrated into the system like "buy two get one free" and "second item half priced", enhancing sales and customer satisfaction.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The system provides a user-friendly shopping interface with robust error handling mechanisms, ensuring seamless navigation and efficient order placement.

## System Structure
The system is divided into several Python files, each handling a distinct aspect of the system:

- `main.py`: This is the main file that runs the inventory management system.
- `store.py`: This file contains the `Store` class, which is responsible for managing the products in the inventory.
- `promotions.py`: This file contains the `Promotion` class and its subclasses, which are responsible for managing the different promotional strategies.
- `product.py`: This file contains the `Product` class and its subclasses, which are responsible for managing the different types of products.

## Running the System
To run the system, simply execute the `main.py` file.

## Project Status
This project is completed and fully functional.

## Future Improvements
Potential future improvements could include integrating a database for persistent storage of product data, adding support for more types of products and promotions, and developing a web-based user interface.
